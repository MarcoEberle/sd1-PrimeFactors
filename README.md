This is my solution to the assignment **PrimeFactors** of class **software developement 1**, written in Java.

More information can be seen in the comments of the source code.


Prime factorization or integer factorization of a number is breaking a number down into the set of prime numbers which multiply together to result in the original number. 

Find the prime factors of 100:

    100 ÷ 2 = 50; save 2
    50 ÷ 2 = 25; save 2
    25 ÷ 2 = 12.5, not evenly so divide by next highest number, 3
    25 ÷ 3 = 8.333, not evenly so divide by try next highest number, 4
    25 ÷ 4 = 6.25, not evenly so divide by try next highest number, 5
    25 ÷ 5 = 5; save 5
    5 ÷ 5 = 1; save 5

List the resulting prime factors as a sequence of multiples, 2 x 2 x 5 x 5 or as factors with exponents, 22 x 52.
